\chapter{Literature Review}\label{ch:literaturereview}

This section gives an overview of the context and background to the research problem.
It builds on your problem definition and aims and objectives and so is an expansion of the concise arguments you make there.
It is probably the section that will give you most scope to show off the wide range of sources you have consulted.
Although based on existing literature, you should still present your material critically.

1)Reiterate your research objectives in the beginning nad outline how the LR will help to answer those

2)Draw on theories/ concepts/ data and critically evaluate the information in the light of the research objectives

3)Deduce hypotheses from the information/ formulate research questions

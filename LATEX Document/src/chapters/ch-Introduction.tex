(The introduction should set out the purpose and scope of the dissertation, clearly explaining what it is about, how it is structured, but more importantly, why the research is necessary and to whom.
You need to ensure that the academic and applied rationale is well explained and justified.
An academic rationale should answer the questions “Why don’t we know this already?
Why is more study on this topic needed?” and an applied rationale should demonstrate the relevance of the topic to contemporary business environments.
The section should end with the main aim and objectives of your study.) \\

Esports is a form of competition using video games where participants will compete either individually or in a team for a chance at victory.
These competitions attract millions of viewers, with estimates of 532 million spectators by the end of 2022, and this value is expected to grow annually at a value of roughly 8.7\%~\citep{newzoo2022viewers}.


As the esports industry continues to grow, so does the importance on teams to gain a competitive edge.
In-depth analysis of matches, teams and in-game factors become key techniques for teams to gain this advantage over their competitors, with teams being required by their leagues to have dedicated groups of coaches and analysts similar to traditional sports teams\citep{LCSRules}.
These coaches and analysts use predictive analytics to maximise their team's likelihood of winning by altering numerous features related to in-game strategies, current 'meta-game' analysis and common patterns of their competition\citep{kokkinakis2021metagaming}.

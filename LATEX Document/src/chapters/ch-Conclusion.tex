1500 words

It can be hard to know which section to discuss your results – this or the preceding one – and you may decide to combine
these two sections into one or more chapters based on theme, depending on your topic and your supervisor’s views.
However, what is vital is that your Dissertation contains sufficient analytical discussion in addition to the more descriptive ‘scene setting’
material of the literature review sections, and presentation of results.
It is here that you will compare and contrast your findings with those already reported in the literature.

Here you need to answer the “So what?” question.
What significance do your research findings have?
For whom?
Why?
and How?
In this chapter you link the research problem with literature review and findings, stating what you can conclude based on the work conducted.
Based on your conclusions you should comment on managerial implications, the limitations of the research, suggest further work and better ways to resolve the problem.
